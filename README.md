# Inno Setup[Used-to-create executable-file]  
This is an Inno Setup script used to create an installer for a Snake game.  

The script sets various properties for the installer, such as the application name, version, publisher, and executable file name. It also specifies the default installation directory and creates an icon for the installed application.  

The [Files] section specifies the source directory for the game files and the destination directory for the installed files.  

Finally, the [Run] section specifies the executable file to be launched after installation.
